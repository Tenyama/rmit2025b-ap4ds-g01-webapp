    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we continue from the preprocessing work in **Task 1** and focus on two main goals:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 2: Generating Feature Representations**  \n",
    "  We transform the cleaned clothing reviews into numerical formats suitable for machine learning.  \n",
    "  Three types of representations are built:  \n",
    "  - **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** using the fixed vocabulary from Task 1  \n",
    "  - **Unweighted embeddings** (FastText average vectors)  \n",
    "  - **TF-IDF weighted embeddings** (FastText weighted by IDF scores)  \n",
    "  Along the way, we check coverage of the embedding model, inspect out-of-vocabulary cases, and save the representations for downstream tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 3: Clothing Review Classification**  \n",
    "  Using the generated features, we train and evaluate multiple classifiers to predict whether a clothing item is **recommended** or not (`Recommended IND`).  \n",
    "  - **Question 1:** Which representation (BoW vs embeddings) works best?  \n",
    "  - **Question 2:** Does adding the **Title** of reviews improve performance compared to Text alone?  \n",
    "\n",
    "For both questions, we use **cross-validation** with multiple metrics (Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, Balanced Accuracy) to account for class imbalance.  \n",
    "We also experiment with **SMOTE oversampling** vs **class weighting** to handle imbalance in the target labels.  "

    "\n",
    "In **Question 2**, we explored whether adding the **Title** field improves classification performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact of Title information:**  \n",
    "  - Adding **Title+Text** consistently improved results across all representations.  \n",
    "  - The best setup was **BoW + MultinomialNB**, reaching **F1 = 0.931, ROC-AUC = 0.931**, outperforming the Text-only baseline.  \n",
    "  - **Title alone** was weaker than Text, but still better than nothing, and combining it with Text yielded the strongest gains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model trends:**  \n",
    "  - **BoW models** remained dominant, with Naive Bayes and Random Forest leading the board.  \n",
    "  - **Embedding models** benefited most from **MLP**, which scored F1 â‰ˆ 0.926 with Title or Title+Text, though still below BoW methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imbalance handling (Balanced vs SMOTE):**  \n",
    "  - SMOTE gave small boosts in **Accuracy and F1** (up to +0.008) but slightly reduced **ROC-AUC and Balanced Accuracy**.  \n",
    "  - Class weighting alone remained sufficient, with SMOTE offering only marginal improvements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall:** Including Title enhances model performance, especially when combined with Text.  \n",
    "While embeddings paired with neural models (MLP) show promise, the simplest approach â€” **BoW + Naive Bayes with Title+Text** â€” remains the most effective solution for this dataset."

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we built feature representations and evaluated classification models for womenâ€™s clothing reviews.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 2:** We generated three types of document representations â€” BoW, unweighted FastText embeddings, and TF-IDF weighted embeddings.  \n",
    "  BoW offered strong baseline features, while embeddings provided dense semantic information but required more complex models to perform well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 3, Question 1:**  \n",
    "  - **BoW** was the most effective representation overall, with **Multinomial Naive Bayes** achieving the top F1 (â‰ˆ0.923) and ROC-AUC (â‰ˆ0.900).  \n",
    "  - Embeddings performed reasonably with non-linear models (MLP), but did not surpass BoW methods.  \n",
    "  - Class weighting proved sufficient for handling imbalance; SMOTE offered only minor gains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 3, Question 2:**  \n",
    "  - Adding **Title** improved performance across all representations.  \n",
    "  - The best model was **BoW + Title+Text with Naive Bayes**, reaching **F1 â‰ˆ 0.931**.  \n",
    "  - Title alone was weaker than Text, but in combination, it provided clear value.  \n",
    "  - Embedding models with MLP also benefited from Title, though they still trailed behind BoW approaches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Final takeaway:**  \n",
    "The simplest representation â€” **BoW combined with review Title and Text** â€” consistently outperformed more complex embedding-based methods.  \n",
    "This highlights how, in practice, well-preprocessed BoW features with the right model can be highly effective for text classification tasks, even compared to modern embeddings."
